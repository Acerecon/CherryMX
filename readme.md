### Cherry profile MX keycaps

This repo contains keycaps for Solidworks keyboard models/assemblies.

If you'd like to create another cap (for example, a 1.75 shift since it isn't included in the initial commit), open the base 1u cap (R3 in this instance) and edit the width in the first extrude. Stock 1u width is 18mm, so you'd want to change it to 18x1.75. For the larger caps, I add another 1.03 modifier (ex, 18 x 6.25 x 1.03) to fix the gaps in between caps.
